User Story: AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>
<br>
This is a Professional portfolio that I have developed to keep up with projects as I go through my web development bootcamp. As projects are completed, they shall be added with an image, as well as a link to the deployed projects that functions when a user clicks on the image.
<br>
Page features functional navigational tools to various sections on the webpage. Contact information is found in the footer.

A link to the deployed app can be found <a href="https://lucasz10.github.io/Zach-Lucas-Portfolio/">here</a>
