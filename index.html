    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p class="summary">
        My name is Zachary Lucas, an aspiring web developer and software engineer. 
        At a basic level, you can summarize me as a passionate volleyball player, and an avid gamer.

                    I absolutely love volleyball, and have been actively playing since 2013. 
                    In recent history, I established and have been managing a semiprofessional
                    volleyball team for the Volleyball League of America, even going as far as 
                    preparing a website for the team, which will be found in the links below as 
                    I complete it.

                    I am recently engaged to the lovely woman above, and we both parent the adorable
                    fur baby as well. She has a background in graphic design, so maybe we can become
                    a duo that develops beautiful websites from our own office. We've already brainstormed
                    multiple ideas that may come to fruition later in this year!

                    My education has taken me all over the place. I first entered Arizona State University
                    pursuing a B.S. in Computer Systems Engineering. My sophomore year, I decided to pursue
                    psychology instead. I graduated in 2017, and for a short time floated around until I came
                    back to engineering as a Fire Protection Design Engineer, even earning certification through
                    Level 2 with Water-Based Systems Layout. Now I'm looking to return to my previous passion in 
                    the tech world. Currently, I am pursuing education through the web development bootcamp hosted
                    by the University of Arizona, and expecting to complete this in December of 2022.
