        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            <br> My name is Zachary Lucas, an aspiring web developer and software engineer. </br>

            <br> My education has taken me all over the place. I first entered Arizona State University
                 pursuing a B.S. in Computer Systems Engineering. My sophomore year, I decided to pursue
                 psychology instead. I graduated in 2017, and for a short time floated around until I came
                 back to engineering as a Fire Protection Design Engineer. Now I'm looking to return to my
                 previous passion in the tech world.

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>
            <br> At a basic level, you can summarize me as a passionate volleyball player, and an avid gamer. </br>

            <br> I absolutely love volleyball, and have been actively playing since 2013. 
                 In recent history, I established and have been managing a semiprofessional
                 volleyball team for the Volleyball League of America.
